      "In 2021, I graduated from Mechanical Engineering, seeking a high-paying job. Despite poor college placements, I pursued opportunities in technical firms. Self-study didn't enhance my coding skills, but AccioJob changed that. Friends had completed DSA and Full-stack courses there, so I joined. AccioJob's online classes were interactive, accessible, and taught by exceptional instructors. I relocated to Kanpur mid-course due to hometown internet issues, ensuring seamless learning. Ultimately, AccioJob refined my coding and technical abilities, securing me an SDE position at MakeMyTrip!",

      "I graduated in 2017 with a mechanical engineering degree & never imagined I could switch to an amazing position so quickly. Although I had experience in the mechanical field, I always wanted to transition to IT but never had the chance. Determined to upskill myself, I researched and found AccioJob to be the best option. The fast-paced environment of the IT field appealed to me, and AccioJob became my guide to help me land a job and receive the perfect training. Their curriculum and teaching style made me feel on par with CS graduates, and the supportive learning environment kept me motivated.",

      "Being from Commerce, I needed an intermediary to help me enter the software industry and I found AccioJob to be a perfect fit. Coming from a Non-Tech background, I had to work harder than students from technical backgrounds preparing for 8-12 hours a day. My batch manager was very supportive and played a crucial role in my journey. My hard work paid off when I received my first interview call after only two months of preparation and landed a job with that company. I would advise non-tech students to be prepared to put in extra effort, but with the right preparation and mindset, they can easily excel in the field.",

      "I pursued my Mechanical Engineering from Satara. After graduation, there were no placements through my college, so I had to search for jobs & got one in Manufacturing & Design but I decided to switch to the IT industry in 2020. I did a quick Google search and stumbled upon AccioJob. I contacted some former students who had secured placements and they assured me that AccioJob would teach me everything I needed to know about programming. When I started learning DSA, it was difficult at first, but with the help of my Mentors, Instructors & Batch Manager, I was able to improve my skills and secure a job.",

      "I was interested in math, so I chose electrical engineering. However, during my final semester, I realised that I wasn't interested in the traditional career paths for electrical engineers, such as government jobs or PSUs. That's when I discovered competitive programming and how it relates to real-life maths. I reached out to seniors who were in the same field and they suggested me to join AccioJob. With the help of AccioJob, I improved my skills and landed a job at Gainsight with a package of 12 LPA. I would encourage others to explore different fields, like I did, and not be afraid to change their career path.",

Their program and placement process were top-notch and helped me gain confidence through mock interviews. The mentors were knowledgeable and supportive, and the focus on projects was instrumental in preparing me for interviews. My experience was truly transformative, and I am grateful for the opportunity to take my career to the next level",

The course not only focuses on technical skills, but also on important soft skills like networking and resume building.

      "I had taken a 2-year gap for JEE prep and after graduating with a B.tech in 2019, I joined AccioJob. Their course structure was great as they started from scratch. The experience with the mentors was fantastic as doubt sessions were held on a regular basis to prepare students for interviews and coding rounds. I gave 2-3 mock and HR interviews as they're good for improving communication skills. The main difficulty I faced was 'Direction' and not knowing what to do as there are many fields like big data, web development, AI/ML, etc. AccioJob helped me here and I was able to improve my DSA and get hired by Cerner.",

      "I had chosen BA as I was looking for a government job. However, during the lockdown, I realised that the IT sector is one that is growing rapidly and I became more and more interested in it. I spent my time researching and learning more about coding, taking free courses on YouTube and other platforms but it wasn't enough. That's when I came across AccioJob. I found the program to be very affordable as compared to other similar courses & found the classes and the Instructors to be very useful & to the point. I would like to say that it's never too late to pursue your passion, even if you have a non-tech background like me.",
